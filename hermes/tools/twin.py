"""Twin tools: the agent's window onto the runtime twin of the target.

The twin is the **real reconstructed software** running in a container on this
box (the VPS Hermes lives on) — a faithful, SAFE, live clone of the target, not
the live service itself. `twin_request` hits that running clone at localhost and
returns whatever it really does. The recorded request/response samples are kept
only as *ground truth*
to prove the running twin matches the target (twin_map shows that surface;
twin_reground re-checks one against the live target).

These tools only register when a sealed twin exists for the project.

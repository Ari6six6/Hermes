"""The sandbox: the box Hermes runs on, and the twin that runs beside it.

Hermes lives on a persistent VPS — you SSH into it from your phone and drive the
REPL there. The runtime twin of a target service runs as a **container on this
same box**, reachable at localhost, decoupled from the GPU (which is still rented
on demand and reached over SSH). There is no remote sandbox to register: the
sandbox is here, and `local_endpoint()` runs commands on it.

"""Provision the sandbox host: make sure a container runtime is on the VPS.

On-demand and idempotent, like hermes.gpu.provision installs vLLM/llama.cpp: a
plain Ubuntu box probably has neither Docker nor Podman on first attach, so we
install Docker from the distro repos (good enough for running a reconstructed
stack; we don't need the upstream Docker CE channel). Re-running is a no-op once
the runtime is present.

The sandbox host is allowed network egress to do this — it has to pull base
images and packages to build the twin. That's the deliberate policy difference
from the GPU box: the sandbox *is* the thing being built, so it installs freely.
